\*Mobile first design. But also responsivr for medium and large screens.

-------- Hero Section ---------------
2 column, LHS = headings, sub headings etc. RHS image
H1 should communicate what user is getting, their result. In our case its a house rewire.
Sub heading should communicate context and how we can provide their result.
CTA button saying Start your rewire.
I dont have any reviews yet so cant use 3 avatars, but i need some sort of social proof.
Below the 2 column layout shoyuld be a full width banner with 3 checkmarks shoing short expectations/outcomes user gets by using us.

------- Problem section -------------
This is where i lay out in more detail what problem the client is facing when starting a rewire.
really paint the picture that the client is the hero, not us.
they are on somewhat of a journey when requiring a rewire. Its a long term benefit. Its building structure and infrastructure.
Maybe we could have a few bullet points asking the client if these problems sound familiar
this wont have any BG colour, and only one centered column.

------- Solution Section ---------------
This is where i step in for the first time as the mentor to fix the problem.
We need to speak about what it is that i saw wrong in the rewire space, painpoints that clients reguarly experienced.
Show i understand the problem and then bring up my own authority. Why im qualified to offer this level of service.
No BG colour, 2 column section with image on the left.
This is where the picture of us comes in. Make it personal.

-------- Services Section --------------
This should be 3 column on desktop, but in my case i only have one service(rewires) so may need to get creative here.

---------- Benefits section --------------
BG colour full width.
3 cards in a row on desktop.
maybe icon on top of paragraphs, with title below and then a super short description.
each card should communicate the benefits that come from our service. not features, benefits. In a non techy way, talk in layman terms.
Speak to the non technical client about what our service will do for them.

---------- Process section ---------------
No BG colour. 3 card layout on desktop
steps number at the top of each layout, with a bg colour.
title of the step
brief sdescription below.
image below that.
book a site visit, we do the work, we sign off at completion etc

---------- Testimonial section -----------------
2 column section, no BG colour.
LHS image of a person looking happy. RHS should be taken from my review. The body of text should have large quote marks above and below.
Should always be a five star graphic below with the reviews name.
Ideally id have 3 smaller ones below the main one, but only have one review. any ideas on social proof i could add? or just not include this part yet?

------------- Features section ------------------
This should be a nice table graphic of sorts.
With checkmark icons next to our features

------------- FAQ section ---------------
These should be clickable drop downs. Not sure what the questions and answers will be yet so we can just use placeholders.4-6.

------------- CTA section ---------------
BG colour full width.
Saying Ready to get started? And then a CTA button to the side of it saying something like book your site visit.
